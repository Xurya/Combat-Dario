# Combat-Dario

2019 Updated Remake of Doodle Dario, since the prototype was a huge success. This new version will likely have combat mechanics, featuring better art and more pronounced use of player psychology in gameplay elements. A few minigames are also drafted, but I cannot promise any of the tested minigames in the original Doodle Dario will appear in the final build. 

Developer Note: 
Progress and goals are still private and WIP like all of my other personal projects. However, I plan on keeping this repository public until it is ready for beta testing in order to encourage friends, WingScythe staff, and other students to keep up to date on progress and give feedback. I expect this project to take a lot longer than the prototype, possibly upwards of a year, and this work is currently kept outside of the WingScythe development group.
