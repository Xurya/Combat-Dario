# Combat-Dario

(WIP) 2019 Updated Remake of Doodle Dario, since the prototype was a huge success back in 2017. This new version will likely have combat mechanics, featuring better art and more pronounced use of player psychology in gameplay elements. There was a lot of good critique on core mechanics that will be fixed in this remake. One key example was the frustration design. Frustration is good to the challenge, but the death penalty of restarting from the beginning was unfair to the player and made gameplay stale from repetition and continuous obstacles.

Developer Note: 
Progress and goals are still private and WIP like all of my other personal projects. However, I plan on keeping this repository public until it is ready for beta testing in order to encourage friends, WingScythe staff, and other students to keep up to date on progress and give feedback. I expect this project to take a lot longer than the prototype, possibly upwards of a year, and this work is currently kept outside of the WingScythe development group.
